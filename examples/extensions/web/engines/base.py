"""Base contract for web search/fetch engines.

Every concrete engine (DDG, Exa, Tavily, …) maps its provider-specific output
into one *normalized* result dict so the rest of the extension — formatting,
rendering, metadata — never depends on which engine produced the results.

Normalized result keys (all optional, default ""):
    title      Display title of the result.
    url        Canonical link to open / fetch.
    snippet    Short text summary / body.
    source     Publisher or site name (news).
    date       Publication date (news).
    image      Direct image URL (images).
    duration   Video length (videos).
    author     Author name (books).
    publisher  Publisher (books).
    info       Extra free-form info (books).
