# Changelog

All notable changes to `tau-coding-agent` are documented here.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-26

### Steering & follow-up reliability
- Mid-task **steering** and **follow-up** messages are now delivered reliably. The
  agent loop was restructured into a unified inner/outer loop that re-polls
  steering after every turn, so a steer that lands on a plain-text turn is injected
  and answered instead of being stranded in the queue.
- Steering/follow-up messages queued *after* the agent loop stops are drained via
  continuation turns rather than silently dropped.
- Injected steering/follow-up messages are now **persisted to the session**, so they
  survive into later turns' context and appear in the session log.
- Continuation turns are kept within the context window (auto-compaction + history
  resync), matching normal turns.
- The pending-queue UI hint clears the moment a steering/follow-up message is
  consumed (queue updates are emitted on consumption, not just on enqueue).

### Extensions
- Programmatic model switching, custom OAuth providers, and deeper tool
  introspection in the Extension API.
- Live extension toggling with clean command unregistration.
- Unified extension configuration lookup and a dynamic settings panel that refreshes
  to reflect live `settings.json` values.
- Richer extension display: manifest metadata, author attribution, and improved
  filtering in `ConfigEntry`.

### Voice input
- New voice input extension with space-hold-to-record.
- Controller lifecycle management (unload/reload), finer-grained (millisecond)
  activation hold timing, and decoupling from TUI internals.

### TUI
- Semantic UI themes in `ToolContext`; extensions now style via theme roles instead
  of internal ANSI constants.
- Interactive mode reorganized into a modular component architecture (primitives,
  overlays, modals) with consolidated utilities.
- New layout primitives: `Constrained`, `Columns`, and `Rows` with sizing utilities.
- Terminal tool output streams to the TUI line-by-line.

### Models & sessions
- Multi-modality model configuration and an availability service with updated
  provider identification.
- Unified session resumption logic with resume-command hints printed on exit.

### Fixes
- Parse the Kitty event-type sub-parameter so arrow keys work in Ghostty.
- Ignore non-dictionary extension values in the settings manager to prevent parsing
  errors.
- Resolve all ruff lint errors and pyright warnings across the codebase.

### Tooling
- Upgrade to Python 3.13; improved input parsing with adaptive release-gap handling
  for character-level auto-repeat.
