# Installation

This page covers installation and authentication setup for Tau and its inference providers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip, uv, or another Python package manager
- An API key or subscription from at least one inference provider

## Install Tau

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install tau-coding-agent
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeomon/Tau.git
cd Tau
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

Check that Tau is installed:

```bash
tau --version
tau --help
```

## Inference Provider Setup

Tau supports multiple LLM providers. Each requires API credentials.

### Anthropic

Set the environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

To obtain an API key, visit [Anthropic's console](https://console.anthropic.com) and create a new key.

### OpenAI

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Get your API key from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Google Gemini

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Create a key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).

### Mistral AI

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
```

Get your key from [Mistral's console](https://console.mistral.ai).

### Ollama (Local)

If running Ollama locally, set the endpoint:

```bash
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

Ollama does not require an API key.

## Configure Authentication

### Environment Variables

The simplest method. Set provider keys as environment variables before launching Tau:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
tau
```

### Configuration File

Store credentials in `~/.tau/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "anthropic": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-ant-..." },
  "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "sk-..." },
  "gemini": { "type": "api_key", "key": "..." }
}
```

The file is created with restricted permissions (`0600`). Credentials in the auth file take priority over environment variables.

### Key Resolution

The `key` field supports:

- **Literal values**: directly used
- **Environment variables**: `"$MY_KEY"` or `"${MY_KEY}"`
- **Shell commands**: `"!security find-generic-password -ws 'anthropic'"` (executed once, cached for the process lifetime)

Examples:

```json
{
  "anthropic": { "type": "api_key", "key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" },
  "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "!op read 'op://vault/item/key'" }
}
```

## Test Your Setup

Test with a simple one-shot prompt to verify credentials work:

```bash
tau --print "Say exactly: hello"
```

This runs Tau once, sends a prompt, prints the response, and exits. If you see a response, authentication is working.

For interactive mode, just run:

```bash
tau
```

When you start Tau, it will load your models. Press `/model` to see all available models for your configured providers.

## Uninstall

To remove Tau:

```bash
pip uninstall tau
```

This removes the tau command but leaves configuration and session data in `~/.tau/`.

## Troubleshooting

### No Models Found

Check that your API key is set correctly:

```bash
env | grep -i "api_key\|key"
```

Verify the key matches your provider's requirements. Some providers (e.g., Anthropic) have specific key formats.

### Provider Connection Errors

If Tau cannot connect to a provider, check:

1. **Network connectivity**: Can you reach the provider's endpoint?
2. **API key validity**: Is your key expired or revoked?
3. **Regional restrictions**: Is your location or IP blocked by the provider?

### Ollama Connection Issues

If using Ollama, ensure the service is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

And verify the endpoint matches your `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` setting.
