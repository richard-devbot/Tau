# Sessions

This page explains how Tau manages sessions, persistence, and branching.

## What Is a Session?

A session is a conversation between you and the agent. Each session includes:

- All messages (user inputs and agent responses)
- Tool calls and results
- Model and provider choices
- Settings and theme choices
- Metadata (creation time, working directory)

Sessions are saved to `~/.tau/sessions/` in a per-project subdirectory so sessions from different projects never mix.

## Session Files

Sessions are stored per-project. The working directory is encoded into a safe subdirectory name:

```text
~/.tau/sessions/
├── --Users-alice-projects-myapp--/
│   ├── 2024-01-15_10-30-45_abc123.jsonl
│   ├── 2024-01-15_14-22-19_def456.jsonl
│   └── 2024-01-16_09-15-33_ghi789.jsonl
└── --Users-alice-projects-other--/
    └── 2024-01-16_11-45-22_jkl012.jsonl
```

The subdirectory name is derived from the absolute path of the working directory (`/Users/alice/projects/myapp` → `--Users-alice-projects-myapp--`). This keeps sessions from different projects completely separate, so browsing with `/resume` always shows only the sessions relevant to the current project.

Files are in JSONL format (one JSON object per line), allowing efficient appending and compression.

## Resume Sessions

### Continue Last Session

Resume your most recent session:

```bash
tau --resume
```

Or the short form:

```bash
tau -r
```

### Browse Sessions

Choose from a list of previous sessions interactively:

Inside a session, use the slash command:

```bash
/resume
```

This opens a searchable picker showing all past sessions for the current project directory.

### Specific Session

Resume a specific session by file path or ID:

```bash
tau --session ~/.tau/sessions/project/2024-01-15_10-30-45_abc123.jsonl
tau --session abc123
```

## Start New Sessions

Start a new session in the current working directory:

```bash
tau
tau --new
```

### Named Sessions

Name a session when starting:

```bash
tau --name "Fix login bug"
```

Or rename during a session:

```text
/name "Updated task name"
```

## Ephemeral Sessions

Run tau without saving anything to disk:

```bash
tau --ephemeral
```

Or the short form:

```bash
tau -e
```

Useful for one-off queries where you don't need the conversation history.

## Session Tree

Every session is a **tree**, not a flat list. When you branch with `/fork` or navigate to a different point in history, tau records a `leaf` entry that points to the new active node. The full conversation history — including all branches — lives in a single JSONL file.

```text
root
 └── msg A (user)
      └── msg B (assistant)
           ├── msg C (user)          ← branch 1
           │    └── msg D (assistant)
           └── msg E (user)          ← branch 2 (current leaf)
                └── msg F (assistant)
```

Each entry has a `parent_id` that links it to its parent. `leaf` entries record navigation — when you switch to a different branch, tau writes a `leaf` entry pointing to the target node, so the active position survives restarts.

## Session Branching

If you want to explore multiple directions from a conversation point:

### Fork from a Specific Message

Use `/tree` to open the session tree navigator, then press Enter on any message node to branch from that point. Alternatively, use `/fork <entry-id>` directly if you know the entry ID.

Forking stays within the same session file — the tree grows a new branch. Both the original path and the new branch coexist in the same JSONL file.

### Clone Current Branch

Duplicate the entire current branch into a new session file and switch into it:

```text
/clone
```

Both sessions start in an identical state. Changes in one do not affect the other. Useful for running parallel explorations or creating a safe copy before a risky change.

### Navigating Branches

Use `/tree` to open the interactive branch navigator. It shows every message node in the session tree, indented by depth, with the current leaf marked `(current)`. Press Enter on any node to navigate to that branch point.

When you navigate to a different branch, tau generates a **branch summary** of the path you're leaving, so context from the abandoned branch isn't lost. The summary is injected into the new branch's context as a `[Branch Summary]` block.

#### Branch summary behaviour

- Generated automatically on navigation — no manual action needed.
- Captures: goal, progress, key decisions, next steps, and files read/modified.
- Stored as a `branch_summary` entry in the session file and included in context whenever you return to that branch.
- Extensions can intercept and customise summaries via the `session_before_tree` event (see [Extensions](extensions.md#event-reference)).

### Resuming a Past Session

Use `/resume` to open a searchable list of past sessions for the current directory, sorted by last modified. Type to filter, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to switch. The current session is excluded from the list.

## Session Information

View details about the current session:

```text
/session
```

Shows a read-only overlay (Esc to close) with:

- **File** — path to the session JSONL file
- **ID** — session identifier
- **Branch depth** — number of entries on the current branch
- **User / Assistant / Tool calls** — message counts on the current branch

## Session Deletion

To delete a session, remove the session file:

```bash
rm ~/.tau/sessions/path_to_project/2024-01-15_10-30-45_abc123.jsonl
```

## Backup Sessions

Sessions are stored in `~/.tau/sessions/`. Back up this directory regularly:

```bash
cp -r ~/.tau/sessions ~/backups/tau-sessions-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Session Format

Session files are JSONL — one JSON object per line. The first line is always a session header; every subsequent line is a session entry.

### Header

```json
{"type": "session", "version": 3, "id": "abc12345", "cwd": "/home/user/project", "timestamp": 1718000000.0}
```

### Entry types

All entries share `id`, `timestamp`, and `parent_id` fields. `parent_id` is null for root entries.

| `type` | Key fields | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `message` | `message` | A user, assistant, or tool message (full message object) |
| `custom_message` | `custom_type`, `content`, `display` | Extension-injected message displayed in the TUI |
| `compaction` | `summary`, `first_kept_entry_id`, `tokens_before` | Context compaction checkpoint — summary of everything before `first_kept_entry_id` |
| `branch_summary` | `from_id`, `summary`, `details`, `from_hook` | Branch navigation summary — captures context from an abandoned conversation path |
| `leaf` | `target_id` | Navigation record — points to the current active node after a branch switch |
| `label` | `target_id`, `label` | Human-readable name attached to an entry (shown in tree view) |
| `thinking_level_change` | `thinking_level` | User changed the extended thinking budget level |
| `model_change` | `model_id`, `provider_id` | User switched models |
| `session_info` | `name` | Session name set via `/name` |
| `custom` | `custom_type`, `data` | Extension-specific metadata (not shown in TUI, not sent to LLM) |

### Example

```jsonl
{"type": "session", "version": 3, "id": "a1b2c3d4", "cwd": "/home/user/myproject", "timestamp": 1718000000.0}
{"type": "message", "id": "e5f6g7h8", "parent_id": null, "timestamp": 1718000001.0, "message": {"role": "user", ...}}
{"type": "message", "id": "i9j0k1l2", "parent_id": "e5f6g7h8", "timestamp": 1718000005.0, "message": {"role": "assistant", ...}}
{"type": "compaction", "id": "m3n4o5p6", "parent_id": "i9j0k1l2", "summary": "## Goal\n...", "first_kept_entry_id": "i9j0k1l2", "tokens_before": 94000, "timestamp": 1718000010.0}
{"type": "branch_summary", "id": "q7r8s9t0", "parent_id": "e5f6g7h8", "from_id": "i9j0k1l2", "summary": "The user explored...", "timestamp": 1718000020.0}
{"type": "leaf", "id": "u1v2w3x4", "parent_id": "m3n4o5p6", "target_id": "i9j0k1l2", "timestamp": 1718000030.0}
```

## Session Storage Location

Sessions are stored in `~/.tau/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`. Each project gets its own subdirectory, so sessions are always scoped to the directory you started tau from.

To use a custom root location:

```bash
tau --session-dir /path/to/custom/sessions
```

## Context Compaction

Long sessions eventually fill the model's context window. Tau handles this automatically through **context compaction**: when the context gets too full, Tau summarizes the older portion of the conversation and replaces it with that summary, keeping the most recent messages intact.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-trigger** — after each agent turn, Tau estimates the current token usage. If `context_tokens > context_window - reserve_tokens`, compaction runs automatically.
2. **Cut-point detection** — Tau walks backwards from the most recent message, accumulating token estimates, until it has identified the `keep_recent_tokens` worth of messages to preserve. It never cuts in the middle of a tool call/result pair.
3. **Summarisation** — the messages before the cut point are sent to the model with a summarisation prompt. The resulting summary is stored in the session file as a `compaction` entry and prepended to the context on the next turn.
4. **Iterative merging** — if compaction has happened before, the new summary prompt includes the previous summary so history is never lost.

### Manual Compaction

Trigger compaction yourself at any time:

```text
/compact
```

Useful before a long task when you want to free up context headroom proactively.

### Configure Compaction

Compaction is controlled by three settings under the `compaction` key in `settings.json`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable or disable automatic compaction |
| `reserve_tokens` | `16384` | Tokens to keep free at the top of the context window; compaction triggers when headroom falls below this |
| `keep_recent_tokens` | `20000` | Approximate token budget for the recent messages that are kept verbatim after compaction |

Example — tighten the trigger and keep more recent history:

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "reserve_tokens": 8192,
    "keep_recent_tokens": 32000
  }
}
```

To disable automatic compaction entirely (you can still run `/compact` manually):

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Custom Compaction via Extensions

Extensions can intercept the `before_compaction` event to replace the default LLM summarisation with their own algorithm — for example, using a cheaper model, a different prompt, or a completely custom strategy. See [Custom Compaction](extensions.md#custom-compaction) in the Extensions guide.

### Compaction in Session Files

Each compaction is saved as a `compaction` entry in the JSONL session file:

```json
{"type": "compaction", "summary": "...", "tokens_before": 94000, "first_kept_entry_id": "...", "timestamp": "..."}
```

This means you can always reload a session and Tau will reconstruct the correct context, even across multiple compaction cycles.
