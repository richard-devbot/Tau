# Usage Guide

This page covers day-to-day usage of tau in interactive mode.

## Interactive Mode

Run `tau` to open the terminal UI. The interface has three areas:

- **Header** — current session info, model, token usage
- **Messages** — conversation history, tool calls, results
- **Editor** — where you type prompts

## Editor Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| Submit message | Press **Enter** |
| New line in editor | Press **Shift+Enter** |
| File reference | Type `@` to browse and insert file paths |
| Paste text | **Ctrl+V** |

## Slash Commands

Type `/` to open the command palette. Commands are fuzzy-searchable — type a few characters to filter.

### Session

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a fresh session |
| `/resume` | Browse and resume a past session interactively |
| `/fork [entry-id]` | Branch the session tree at a specific entry |
| `/tree` | Navigate the session tree and switch to a different branch |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current session at the current position |
| `/compact` | Summarise and compact the current context |
| `/name [name]` | Set or show the session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info, message counts, and stats |

### Model & Appearance

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model` | Open the model picker |
| `/theme` | Open the theme picker |
| `/effort` | Set the thinking effort level |

### Authentication

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login` | Save credentials for a provider (API key or OAuth subscription) |
| `/logout` | Remove stored credentials for a provider |

### Other

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/clear` | Clear all messages from the current session |
| `/copy` | Copy the last assistant message to the clipboard |
| `/reload` | Reload extensions, skills, prompts, and settings |
| `/settings` | Show current settings |
| `/help` or `/?` | List all commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/quit` or `/q` or `/exit` | Exit tau |

Extensions, prompts, and user-invocable skills also appear in the command palette. Type `/` and browse to see everything available. Skills can be invoked either as `/skill-name`, through the legacy `/skill:skill-name` form, or through any extra command names declared in the skill frontmatter.

## Command Details

### `/resume`

Opens a searchable session picker showing all past sessions for the current directory, sorted by last modified. Each row shows the session filename, timestamp, message count, and working directory. Type to filter, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to switch.

### `/tree`

Opens the session tree navigator showing every message node in the current session, indented by depth. Entry ID prefix and the first 60 characters of the message are shown. `(current)` marks the active leaf. Enter navigates to the selected branch point.

### `/fork [entry-id]`

Branches the session tree at a specific entry ID. Creates a new branch from that point while preserving the original. Useful when you want to explore a different direction from a past message. Entry IDs are shown in `/tree`.

### `/clone`

Duplicates the entire current branch into a new session file and switches into it. Both sessions start identical — changes in one do not affect the other. Useful for running parallel explorations from the same starting point.

### `/name [name]`

With an argument: sets the session display name (stored in the session file as a `session_info` entry).

Without an argument: shows the current session name if one is set.

```text
/name Fix login regression
```

Named sessions appear with their name in `/resume` instead of the raw filename.

### `/session`

Prints session info inline in the chat. Shows:

- **Session Info** — Name (if set), File path, ID
- **Messages** — User, Assistant, Tool calls, Tool results, Total
- **Tokens** — Input, Output, Cache read (if any), Cache write (if any), Total
- **Cost** — Total USD cost (only shown if non-zero)

### `/copy`

Finds the last assistant message on the current branch and copies its text content to the system clipboard. Uses `pbcopy` on macOS, `wl-copy` / `xclip` / `xsel` on Linux.

### `/login`

If both OAuth and API key providers are available, first asks which authentication type to use:

- **Subscription** — OAuth flow (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex). Opens the browser automatically and prompts for any required input (device code, redirect URL) inside the TUI. Credentials are saved to `~/.tau/auth.json`.
- **API key** — Shows a list of API-key providers. Select one and paste the key into the secure input overlay (displayed as `***`). Key is saved to `~/.tau/auth.json`.

### `/logout`

Shows a list of providers that have credentials stored in `~/.tau/auth.json`. Select one to remove it. Environment variables and CLI flags are not affected.

### `/compact`

Immediately runs context compaction on the current session: summarises old messages with the LLM and replaces them with a compact summary. Useful when you are approaching the context limit or want to free up space before a large task.

### `/reload`

Reloads extensions, themes, skills, prompts, and keybindings without restarting the session. Useful after editing an extension or adding a new skill file. The session itself (messages, history) is unchanged.

### `/clear`

Clears all messages from the current session, starting fresh while staying in the same session file. Unlike `/new`, this does not create a new session — just empties the message history.

## Message Queue

While the agent is working you can queue new messages:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Queue a steering message | Press **Enter** (delivered after the current tool round-trip) |
| Queue a follow-up message | Press **Alt+Enter** (delivered when the agent goes fully idle) |
| Restore queued messages to editor | Press **Alt+Up** |
| Abort the current turn | Press **Escape** or **Ctrl+C** |

## Sessions

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.tau/sessions/`, organised by working directory.

```bash
tau                  # new session
tau --resume         # continue most recent session
tau --session abc123 # resume specific session by ID
tau --ephemeral      # temporary session, nothing saved
```

## Context Files

Tau loads context files at startup to give the agent standing instructions. It searches for:

1. `.agents.md` or `agents.md` in current directory and parent directories (up to home)
2. `~/.tau/agents.md` in the user's home

Use context files to provide system-level instructions:

```markdown
# Agent Instructions

- This is a Python CLI framework project
- All code must have type hints
- Run tests before suggesting changes
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
```

These instructions are automatically injected into every turn, helping the agent understand your project conventions and constraints.

## File References

Type `@` in the editor to fuzzy-search for a file and insert a reference. The file's contents are prepended to your message when you submit.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Enter | Submit message |
| Shift+Enter | Insert newline |
| Alt+Enter | Queue follow-up message |
| Alt+Up | Restore queued messages |
| Ctrl+V | Paste |
| Ctrl+U | Clear input |
| Ctrl+W | Delete previous word |
| Ctrl+A / Home | Move to line start |
| Ctrl+E / End | Move to line end |
| Ctrl+K | Delete to end of line |
| Ctrl+C | Abort turn (double-press to quit) |
| Ctrl+D | Quit (on empty input) |
| Escape | Abort turn / dismiss picker |
| Ctrl+O | Toggle expand/collapse for template blocks |
