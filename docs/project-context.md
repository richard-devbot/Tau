# Project Context Files

Tau automatically discovers and includes project-specific instructions from `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the agent's system prompt. This lets you provide project-level guidance without modifying tool configuration or global settings.

## Overview

When you run Tau in a project directory, it:
1. Looks for `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` (case-insensitive)
2. If found and the project is trusted, includes the content in the system prompt
3. Prioritizes project instructions above general Tau guidelines

This is useful for:
- **Coding standards** — Define how the agent should write code
- **Project conventions** — Specify naming patterns, directory structure expectations
- **Tools & workflows** — Document project-specific development workflows
- **Context** — Provide background on architecture, constraints, decisions

## Usage

### Creating a project context file

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Keep functions under 50 lines

## File Organization
```
src/
├── models/       # Database models
├── handlers/     # Request handlers
├── utils/        # Utility functions
└── tests/        # Test files
```

## Architecture Notes
- We use FastAPI for the REST API
- Pydantic for data validation
- SQLAlchemy for database access

## Common Tasks
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Format code: `black src/`
- Type check: `mypy src/`
```

Or use `CLAUDE.md` for the same purpose (they're equivalent).

### File priority

Tau checks for these files in order (case-insensitive):
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `AGENTS.MD`
3. `CLAUDE.md`
4. `CLAUDE.MD`

The first one found is used.

## Trust & Security

Project context files are only loaded if:
1. **Not disabled** via `--no-context-files` flag
2. **Project is trusted** (via CLI flags, trust store, or settings policy)

### Trust decisions

By default, Tau's behavior is "ask" — it will ask if the project should be trusted the first time you run it (if there are trust decisions to make).

**Control trust behavior with:**

#### CLI Flags (one-time)

**Always trust this project for this run:**
```bash
tau --approve
```

**Never trust this project for this run:**
```bash
tau --no-approve
```

**Disable project context for this run:**
```bash
tau --no-context-files
```

#### Settings (persistent)

Configure the default project trust policy in `~/.tau/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "project_trust": "ask"
}
```

**Options:**
- `"ask"` (default) — Ask each time (stored in `~/.tau/trust.json`)
- `"always"` — Always trust all projects
- `"never"` — Never trust any project

Example configurations:

```json
{
  "project_trust": "always"
}
```

For teams using Tau, you can:
- Set global policy to `"ask"` — Users decide per project
- Set global policy to `"always"` — Auto-load all context files
- Set global policy to `"never"` — Require explicit `--approve` flag

## System Prompt Integration

Project context is included in the system prompt in the "# Project Instructions" section:

```
You are a coding agent...

## How to work
- Always use absolute paths...

# Available Tools
- **read** — Read files...

Tau documentation
- README: ...

# Project Instructions

Project-specific guidelines and rules (from AGENTS.md):

[Content of AGENTS.md here]

Follow project-specific instructions before general Tau guidelines.
```

The agent sees this and prioritizes project instructions when making decisions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Python project

**AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
# Python Project Rules

## Style
- Type annotations required
- Use f-strings for formatting
- No wildcard imports
- Docstrings for all public functions

## Testing
- Run `pytest` before committing
- Keep test coverage above 80%
- Use fixtures for common setup

## Code Review
- Explain the "why" in docstrings
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
```

### Example 2: JavaScript/TypeScript project

**CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
# TypeScript Conventions

## Setup
- Node.js 18+
- Pnpm for package management
- ESLint + Prettier for formatting

## Code Rules
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- No `any` types without justification
- Async/await preferred over promises
- Use named exports, not default

## Build & Test
- Build: `pnpm run build`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Lint: `pnpm run lint`
```

### Example 3: Monorepo

**AGENTS.md:**
```markdown
# Monorepo Structure

## Packages
- `packages/core/` — Core library
- `packages/cli/` — CLI interface
- `packages/web/` — Web UI
- `packages/docs/` — Documentation

## Development
- Each package has its own test suite
- Root `test` script runs all tests
- Use `npm` workspaces

## Deployment
- Build: `npm run build` from root
- Core: Publish to npm
- Web: Deploy to Vercel
- CLI: GitHub releases
```

## Common Issues

**Project context not appearing**
- Check the file exists in the project root
- Verify filename is exactly `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
- Check project trust: `tau --approve` or `/trust` command
- Use `--no-context-files` to confirm it's being loaded

**Want to see if it's loaded**
- Run with `--verbose` flag for logging (when available)
- Check system prompt in `/session` command

**Trust decisions not persisting**
- By default, trust decisions are stored in `~/.tau/trust.json`
- Use `--approve` to explicitly trust for that run
- Check `~/.tau/trust.json` to see stored decisions

## Comparison with other approaches

| Approach | When to use | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| **AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md** | Team project guidelines | Lightweight, auto-discovered, version-controlled | Limited to per-project |
| **Custom prompt (`--system-prompt`)** | One-off instructions | Flexible | Lost after session |
| **settings.json** | User/global preferences | Persistent | Not project-specific |
| **Environment variables** | Sensitive data, deployment-specific | Secure, flexible | Not human-readable |

For team projects, **AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md is recommended** because:
- Stays with the codebase (Git history)
- Clear intent and discoverability
- Auto-loaded without configuration
- Can be reviewed in PRs
