# Tau Documentation

Tau is a Python CLI framework for building interactive agent applications. It provides a terminal chat interface backed by any supported LLM provider, extensible tool execution, persistent session management, and a comprehensive plugin system.

## What is Tau?

Tau allows you to:
- Chat with LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama) in a terminal UI
- Execute tools (terminal commands, read/write files, fetch web content) within conversations
- Save and resume sessions with branching and forking
- Extend Tau with custom tools, commands, themes, and skills
- Embed Tau in Python applications as a library
- Integrate with IDEs via JSON-RPC
