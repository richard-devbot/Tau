# Messages & Context

This page explains how tau handles messages, context, and conversation history.

## Message Types

Tau's message system supports several types of messages:

### User Message

A message from the user. Contains the prompt text and optionally referenced files. Tau supports text, image, audio, and video files.

```python
{
  "type": "user",
  "content": "Transcribe this audio",
  "references": ["@audio.mp3"]
}
```

Referenced files are automatically processed based on type:
- **Text files** — content included directly
- **Images** — sent as base64-encoded visual data
- **Audio files** — sent for transcription or analysis
- **Video files** — sent for scene analysis or transcription

### Assistant Message

A response from the LLM. Can include text and tool calls.

```python
{
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": "Here's a summary...",
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_123",
      "tool": "read",
      "input": {"path": "src/main.py"}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tool Result

Output from executing a tool.

```python
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool": "read",
  "call_id": "call_123",
  "content": "File contents here",
  "error": null
}
```

### System Message

Context and instructions for the agent. Loaded from `.agents.md` file in project or home directory.

```python
{
  "type": "system",
  "content": "You are an agent that helps with code tasks..."
}
```

## Context Window

The context window is the total number of tokens sent to the LLM in each request.

### Token Counting

Check your current token usage with `/session`:

```text
Tokens: 2,456 input | 543 output | ~3,000 total
Cost: ~$0.012 (estimated)
```

### Token Limits

Each model has a maximum context window:

| Model | Context | Max Output |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| claude-3-5-sonnet | 200k | 4k |
| gpt-4 | 8k | 4k |
| gemini-2.0-flash | 1M | 8k |
| mistral-large | 32k | 32k |
| ollama/mistral | 32k | 32k |

### Context Compression

When messages get too long, tau automatically compresses older messages to stay within limits. This happens transparently and maintains conversation continuity.

## Message History

Messages are stored in your session file, saved to disk automatically.

### View History

Run `/session` to see:
- All messages in the current branch
- Token counts per message
- Timestamps

### Clear History

Start a new session:

```bash
tau --new
```

Resume from a specific point:

```bash
tau --resume
```

## File References

Reference files in your prompt to add their contents to the message:

```python
@src/main.py "What does this function do?"
@src/app.ts @src/app.css "Review these together"
```

Tau automatically:
1. Locates the files
2. Reads their contents
3. Adds them to the message context

Use `@` in the editor to fuzzy-search files.

## System Instructions

Tau loads system instructions from `.agents.md` files in your project or home directory:

**Project-level** (priority):
- `.agents.md` or `agents.md` in project root or parent directories
- Injected into context for the current project

**Global**:
- `~/.tau/agents.md` in home directory
- Used as fallback for all projects

Example `.agents.md`:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

- Always run tests after code changes
- Focus on performance and security
- Keep responses concise
- Use type hints in Python code
```

Instructions are automatically injected into every turn sent to the LLM.

## Message Delivery

Configure how steering and follow-up messages are delivered in [Settings](settings.md):

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `one-at-a-time` | Each message queued and sent separately |
| `all` | All queued messages sent together |

- [Settings](settings.md) - Configure message behavior
- [Usage Guide](usage.md) - Interactive mode features
