"""Engine-loop tests for steering / follow-up injection and pending-queue display sync.

Covers the two bugs fixed in tau/engine/service.py:

1. Display sync — a ``QueueUpdateEvent`` is emitted when steering / follow-up
   messages are *consumed* (dequeued), not only when they are enqueued, so the
   TUI's pending-queue hint clears the moment a message lands in history.

2. Steering on a plain-text turn — the loop re-polls steering after every turn and
   its condition keeps running while messages are pending, so a steer that arrives
   when the turn ends with a plain text answer is injected and drives another turn
   instead of being stranded in the queue and never sent to the model.
